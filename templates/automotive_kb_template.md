## 1. How to Use

- Fill in **Candidate Details** (`{position}`, `{experience}`, `{skill_level}`) before starting.
- For each topic, the AI will tailor questions based on your details.
- Each topic includes 5 question types:
  - Puzzle/problem-solving
  - Project/application
  - Concept understanding
  - Opinion/viewpoint
  - Use case/scenario
- After answering, you may:
  - Request feedback or best answers.
  - Ask for a new set of questions from the same topic.
  - Move to a new topic.
- If no topic is specified, the AI selects one randomly.
- Continue until all topics are covered or you choose to stop.
