## How to Use

- Fill in **Candidate Details** (`{position}`, `{experience}`, `{skill_level}`) before starting.
- For each topic, the AI will tailor questions based on your Candidate Details.
- Each topic includes 5 question types:
  - Puzzle/problem-solving
  - Project/application
  - Concept understanding
  - Opinion/viewpoint
  - Use case/scenario
- After answering, request feedback or ask to see best answers.
- You may request a new set of questions from the same topic or move to a new topic.
- If no topic is specified, the AI will select one randomly from the list.
- Continue until all topics are covered or you request to stop.

## Example Interaction

**AI:**  
*Topic: CAN Protocol (tailored for Senior Automation Architect, 12 years experience)*  
1. Puzzle: "How would you architect a scalable solution for debugging intermittent CAN bus errors across multiple ECUs in a production vehicle?"  
2. Project: "Describe a project where you led the automation of CAN protocol testing. What frameworks and scripting approaches did you use?"  
3. Concept: "Explain the trade-offs between standard and extended CAN frames in large automotive networks."  
4. View: "What is your strategy for ensuring CAN bus reliability and fault tolerance in safety-critical systems?"  
5. Use Case: "Identify three advanced use cases for CAN protocol in next-generation vehicles."

**You:**  
*Type your answers...*

**AI:**  
*Provides feedback and best answers if requested.*

**AI:**  
*Would you like a new set of questions from CAN Protocol, or move to a new topic?*
