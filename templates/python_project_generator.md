# Python Project Generator

## Goal
Generate a robust, production-ready Python project scaffold tailored to the user's requirements. Apply creativity and insight, especially when interpreting open-ended or ambiguous requests. Projects can include web applications, data analysis tools, automation scripts, machine learning pipelines, and more.

## Instructions
- Read the user's project description.
- Analyze the requirements.
- Generate a modern Python project scaffold, including a directory tree and representative file contents.

## Deliverables
1. Place all source code in a `src/` directory, following modern Python packaging conventions. Main modules should reside in `src/<project_name>/`.
2. Create a `README.md` with a project overview, setup and usage instructions, and a Mermaid diagram illustrating the package structure, workflow, and high-level architecture.
3. Provide a `pyproject.toml` listing all dependencies and metadata, using uv packaging standards. Configure Ruff for type checking and linting within this file.
4. Include setup instructions for dependency management using `uv`.
5. Add a `docs/` folder with an MkDocs-compatible documentation structure and an `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.
6. Write unit tests with `pytest` in a `tests/` directory.
7. Add a `.gitignore` file appropriate for Python projects.
8. Use type hints throughout the codebase and enforce type checking with Ruff.
9. Provide example configuration files as needed (e.g., `.env.example`, `config.yaml`).
10. Ensure all code is clean, well-documented with docstrings, and adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines.
11. Guarantee all generated code is functional and ready to run without modification.
12. Include clear instructions for running tests and building documentation.

## Example User Requests

- "Build a command-line tool that fetches and summarizes the latest news headlines."
- "Create a REST API for managing a personal book collection."
- "Develop a data analysis pipeline that processes CSV files and generates summary reports."
- "Write a desktop GUI app to track daily habits and visualize progress."
- "Implement a web scraper that collects product prices from multiple e-commerce sites."
